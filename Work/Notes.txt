Type Conversion :Converting snaller Data Type to Bigger Data Type is called Type Conversion.
It is done Automatically

Type Casting:Converting Bigger data type to Smaller Data Type is called Type Casting
It is done explicitly

Conversion is done by (Conv Type)

Ex 
float f=(float) double;

Control Statements :Helps in skipping ,lopping some java statement based on certain conditions
there are 3 types 

1.if,if-else,switch --->Selection statement means based on condition it selects part of the code to execute
2.for,while,do-while  --->Based on certain condition a block of code executes multiple times.
3.break,continue,return --->Based on certan conditions a block of code is skipped.


'if' is a two way branch --->either True or False 
'if-else-if' is a multi way branch .But switch provides better functionality in multi way branching.
'switch' is a multiple way branch -->based on many selections it selects block of code to execute. 


Fall through :- Fall through is a case when there is no Break statement in Switch case and the programm cotinues to execute remaining Statements
Switch may or maynot contain break; statement 
if may or maynot contain else statement

Variables are not allowed in case statements.

Scope of Variables inside the block 

For a Global variable the value modified inside the block is final .
the variable declared inside the block is confined to the same block and it is dead outside of the block.
Global variables cannot be created in Child blocks .
But a variable created in the Child block can be again created out side to the block and other child blocks.

For Vs While
--------------
for loop is used when we know that number of iteration we perform
While loop is used when we dont know the number of iterations to perform
But both can be interchangeable 

For loop can be written without initialization,expression,increment
